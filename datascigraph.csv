"3,What kind of graph would you use to show the parts of a whole?,A pie chart. For example, a pie chart could show what parts of your lunch are fruits, vegetables, proteins, and grains."
"4,What does the height of each bar in a bar chart represent?,The height of a bar shows the size or amount of the category it represents. For example, if you're looking at a bar chart of class test scores, a taller bar means more students received that score."
"5,What type of plot would you use to see the relationship between two variables?,A scatter plot. This type of plot can help you see how two things are connected, like comparing the number of hours spent studying and the scores on a test."
"6,Why use a histogram?,A histogram shows how often data falls into certain ranges or bins. It's great for understanding the distribution of data, like how many students fall into different grading ranges."
"7,What does data visualization help with?,Data visualization helps to make sense of data by turning numbers into graphs and charts, which makes it easier to see patterns and trends. For example, you can quickly see which month had the most rain."
"8,Why use different colors in a chart?,Using different colors in a chart helps to distinguish between different groups or types of data. For example, in a chart showing favorite fruits, apples can be red, bananas yellow, and grapes purple."
"9,How do you calculate the mean of a set of numbers?,To find the mean, add all the numbers together and then divide by the number of items. For instance, the mean of 2, 4, and 6 is (2+4+6)/3 = 4."
"10,What is a pie chart good for?,A pie chart is good for showing how a total is divided into parts, like showing what percentage of the class likes each type of game."
"11,What is an example of qualitative data?,Qualitative data describes qualities or characteristics. For example, types of animals, colors of cars, or names of students in a class."
"12,What is quantitative data?,Quantitative data is numerical and can be measured. For example, ages, heights, or the number of books read."
"13,How does a line graph show trends?,A line graph shows trends over time by connecting data points with a line, making it easy to see increases, decreases, or steady patterns. For example, it can show how a plant's height grows week by week."

"19,How do you find the median of a list of numbers?,To find the median, organize the numbers in order and then pick the middle one. If there's an even number of items, the median is the average of the two middle numbers."
"20,What is a mode?,The mode is the number that appears most frequently in a data set. For example, if you survey friends on their favorite ice cream flavor and most choose chocolate, then chocolate is the mode."
"21,What is the importance of labeling axes on graphs?,Labeling the axes on a graph helps people understand what the numbers and information represent, making the graph clearer and more useful."
"22,Why would you use a bar graph instead of a pie chart?,You might use a bar graph instead of a pie chart when you want to show changes over time or compare many different items or categories, as it's easier to see differences in height than changes in pie slices."
"23,What is an example of a misleading graph?,A misleading graph might have scales that are too compressed or expanded, making differences appear smaller or larger than they really are. For example, starting a bar graph's y-axis at 50 instead of 0 can make small differences look big."

"44,How can you tell if a graph is accurate?,To tell if a graph is accurate, check if the data it's based on is reliable, whether it's drawn to scale, and if it's labeled correctly. Also, check if it uses appropriate graph types for the data it is presenting."
"45,What is the significance of the 'mean' in data?,The mean is significant because it represents the average value of a data set, giving a central point around which the rest of the data varies. It helps in understanding the overall behavior of the data."
"46,How do you calculate the range of a data set?,To calculate the range of a data set, subtract the smallest number from the largest number. For example, if the highest score is 100 and the lowest is 60, then the range is 100 - 60 = 40."
